Dataverse-Jenkins
=================

This repository aims to document the configuration of automated testing for [Dataverse][] and its satellite projects.

The [Odum Institute][] hosts [jenkins.dataverse.org][] which is meant to serve as a dashboard of Dataverse-related projects. To add your project to the dashboard, please start by opening an issue.

If you would like to stand up your own Jenkins instance for building Dataverse and related projects, please see [INSTALL.md][].

For more information on testing Dataverse, please see the [Testing][] section of the Dataverse Developer Guide.
